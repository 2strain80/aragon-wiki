It implements features like a cap table,\ntoken transfers, voting, roles, fundraising and accounting. Aragon organizations are easily\ncustomizable, and they are also extensible by installing third party modules.\n\n\nAragon organizations will be able to opt-in into the Aragon Network, which will provide\nservices like upgradeability and a decentralized court arbitration system for Aragon\norganizations.\n\n\nFor more information, please refer to our website our dapp white paper and our Network\nwhitepaper.\n\n\nThis document describes how Aragon Dev plans to develop the Aragon dapp, the Aragon\nNetwork and how Aragon Dev is positioned in the larger context of the Aragon project.\u2029\n\n\nHistory \n Vision\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuis and Jorge have been dreaming of a decentralized world for years. They met via Twitter\nwhen they were only 15 years old, and immediately started building products together.\n\n\nAt the age of 17, they prototyped a fully decentralized Internet replacement by using mesh\nnetworks, blockchain technology and protocols like Bluetooth LE and WiFi Direct.\n\n\nStampery\u2014Luis\u2019 latest company\u2014made blockchain timestamping accessible, and has\nworked with institutions like the Estonian government, Microsoft and Telefonica. It\nparticipated in TechCrunch Disrupt and was backed by billionaire Tim Draper.\n\n\nLuis has also been recognized as a 30 Under 30 by Forbes and Innovator Under 35 by the\nMIT.\n\n\nBefore building Aragon, Luis and Jorge were in Silicon Valley working on solving the problem\nof patent trolls with Unpatent. After figuring out how broken the underlying infrastructure of\ninnovation is\u2014patent trolls thriving, Donald Trump winning the elections, bureaucracy\neating entrepreneurship\u2014they decided to focus all of their time in building the\ninfrastructure that new companies and organizations will run on top of.\u2029\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen talking about Aragon, taking a step back and thinking about the why of organizational\nstructures like companies is a sane move.\nFirms or companies exist in order to create value by using resources to create products or\nprovide services.\nHowever, intermediaries and third parties such as governments decrease the output of\nthose organizations by imposing restrictions and creating complex regulatory frameworks.\nAragon was born to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of companies and other\norganizational structures.\n\n\nLuis and Jorge were very inspired by Nobel prize Ronald Coase and his amazing paper The\nNature of the Firm and Yochai Benkler's Linux and the Nature of the Firm. Both explore the\nconcept of company.\n\n\nAt Aragon Dev, we believe that the blockchain and the Internet are changing the incentives\nfor companies to exist, and we are building tools for the next generation of companies that\nwill take advantage of these changes.\n\n\nHowever, for decentralized organizations to be widespread, we need to make sure that they\nare easy to use, upgradeable/durable and able to resolve human disputes.\n\n\nWe want to solve\u2014either us or partnering with others\u2014those points in order to make\ndecentralized organizations widespread.\n\n\nAnd, thanks to the Aragon dapp and the Aragon Network, we can solve those points.\n\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAragon Community\n, defining the community members contributing to the dapp and Network\nand the Aragon Network Token holders.\n\n\nAragon MTU\n, from now on, \nthe Foundation\n, a non-profit organization based in Estonia, will\nserve as the umbrella organization responsible for allocating resources to other bodies for\nfuture cryptocurrency research and development going forward. The board of the\nFoundation consists of Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo. The Foundation will focus on\noverarching the mission and will enable operating organizations to accomplish the day-to-\nday work.\n\n\nThe Foundation will also serve as a governance entity that will listen the Community until\nthe Aragon Network is fully operational, from where the full governance of the Network will\nbe transferred to the ANT holders.\n\n\nAragon Dev\n, a for-profit corporation that will be founded after the token sale is finished, and\nwill serve the Foundation and employ a team that will work on the Aragon platform. It will\nalso serve as a service provider for the Aragon Network.\n\n\nFunding Priorities\n It is intended that the Foundation will deploy the revenue from the token\nsale as depicted in the Intended Use of Revenue document, but it reserves the right to make\nchanges if it deems them necessary.\n\n\nDevelopment Milestones\n\n\nWe will divide development milestones in the form of releases.\nEach release may have multiple deployment stages, from being in alpha stage\u2014running on\nthe test network\u2014to begin in the production stage\u2014running on the main network\u2014going\nthrough multiple testing, security and QA stages.\n\n\n0.1 \u2014 The Initial Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis the first release on macOS after months of work and weeks of privately-conducted\ncommunity testing. Featured all the basic functionality that an organization needs to\noperate. It was not made public.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Alpha\n: February 2017\n\n\n\n\n0.2 \u2014 The Public Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was the first public release. Working in both macOS, Linux and Windows.

Stampery\u2014Luis\u2019 latest company\u2014made blockchain timestamping accessible, and has\nworked with institutions like the Estonian government, Microsoft and Telefonica. It\nparticipated in TechCrunch Disrupt and was backed by billionaire Tim Draper.  Luis has also been recognized as a 30 Under 30 by Forbes and Innovator Under 35 by the\nMIT.  Before building Aragon, Luis and Jorge were in Silicon Valley working on solving the problem\nof patent trolls with Unpatent. After figuring out how broken the underlying infrastructure of\ninnovation is\u2014patent trolls thriving, Donald Trump winning the elections, bureaucracy\neating entrepreneurship\u2014they decided to focus all of their time in building the\ninfrastructure that new companies and organizations will run on top of.\u2029     When talking about Aragon, taking a step back and thinking about the why of organizational\nstructures like companies is a sane move.\nFirms or companies exist in order to create value by using resources to create products or\nprovide services.\nHowever, intermediaries and third parties such as governments decrease the output of\nthose organizations by imposing restrictions and creating complex regulatory frameworks.\nAragon was born to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of companies and other\norganizational structures.  Luis and Jorge were very inspired by Nobel prize Ronald Coase and his amazing paper The\nNature of the Firm and Yochai Benkler's Linux and the Nature of the Firm. Both explore the\nconcept of company.  At Aragon Dev, we believe that the blockchain and the Internet are changing the incentives\nfor companies to exist, and we are building tools for the next generation of companies that\nwill take advantage of these changes.  However, for decentralized organizations to be widespread, we need to make sure that they\nare easy to use, upgradeable/durable and able to resolve human disputes.  We want to solve\u2014either us or partnering with others\u2014those points in order to make\ndecentralized organizations widespread.  And, thanks to the Aragon dapp and the Aragon Network, we can solve those points.",
