Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Aragon team.\n\n\nSome Aragon project's spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.\n\n\nOur Standards\n\n\nExamples of \nbehavior that contributes to creating a positive environment\n include:\n\n\n\n\nUsing welcoming and inclusive language\n\n\nBeing respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n\n\nGracefully accepting constructive criticism\n\n\nFocusing on what is best for the community\n\n\nShowing empathy towards other community members\n\n\n\n\nExamples of \nunacceptable behavior\n by participants include:\n\n\n\n\nThe use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances\n\n\nTrolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n\n\nPublic or private harassment\n\n\nImpersonating a Aragon team member\n\n\nPublishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\n\n\nOffensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion\n\n\nUnwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment\n\n\nDeliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names\n\n\nPhysical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like \"\nhug\n\" or \"\nbackrub\n\") without consent or after a request to stop\n\n\nThreats of violence\n\n\nIncitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm\n\n\nDeliberate intimidation\n\n\nStalking or following\n\n\nHarassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes\n\n\nSustained disruption of discussion\n\n\nPattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others\n\n\nContinued one-on-one communication after requests to cease\n\n\nDeliberate \"outing\" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse\n\n\nPublication of non-harassing private communication\n\n\nOther conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\n\n\n\nAragon prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. Aragon team reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:\n\n\n\n\n'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'\n\n\nReasonable communication of boundaries, such as \"leave me alone,\" \"go away,\" or \"I'm not discussing this with you\"\n\n\nCommunicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial\n\n\nCriticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions\n\n\n\n\nOur Responsibilities\n\n\nAragon team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\n\nAragon team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any community member or contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n\nReporting\n\n\nIf you are being harassed by a member of the Aragon community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the Aragon team at \nAragon Slack\n. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as possible.\n\n\nThis code of conduct applies to Aragon community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Aragon community or team member outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Aragon community or team members seriously. This includes harassment outside of our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The team reserves the right to exclude people from the Aragon community at their discretion, based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Aragon spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Aragon community.\n\n\nIn order to protect the Aragon team from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.\n\n\nWe will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Aragon community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.\n\n\nScope\n\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within the Aragon project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include presenting themselves as Aragon community members, promoting the Aragon project as well as using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by the Aragon team.\n\n\nEnforcement\n\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Aragon projects team at \nAragon Slack\n. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The Aragon team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\n\nAragon community members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the Aragon team.\n\n\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\n\n\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Aragon response team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Aragon project spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Aragon community members or the general public.\n\n\nSlack\n\n\nAragon project's Slack channels descriptions tell you what is considered proper on-topic discussion on that channel, we want everyone to abide by these discussion topics, but using common sense is allowed. We won't remove you from the channel unless there is sustained disruption of discussion. All communication in the channels is to be in English, unless stated otherwise.\n\n\nKeep your messages \nDRY\n, don't repeat yourself, choose a proper channel to post your message, link or other communication and only post that on one channel.

Time 15.00 CEST.\n\n\nDiscussion about the state of Aragon, near future plans and decisions that need to be made. 10 min presentations with slides from team members, in which each one will run through the most important things we have done during the month, the problems they have found, and what they plan to do next month (that can be a bit blurry, and that's fine)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacilitator\n: Project Lead\n\n\nParticipants\n: All Aragon team members + possible relevant contributors\n\n\nViewers\n: Public on Youtube\n\n\n\n\nCommunity meeting\n\n\n\n\nMonthly, second Friday of the month.

Questions will be submitted through \nReddit\n and answered live\n\n\nWe\u2019ll have templates that can/will be used for the basis of agendas in Meetings so the Facilitator can easily fill out each Meetings info, like who will be presenting what, who has slides etc.\n\n\nFacilitator of the Meeting will make sure that the discussion stays on rails, everyone gets a chance to speak their mind, everything on the agenda is discussed, necessary decisions are made and that the Meeting length stays on a reasonable length\n\n\n\n\nUncertainties\n\n\nNone right now, version 1.0 is finalized!\n\n\nContributions\n\n\nThanks to @kennyrowe for the feedback on this!\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nhttps://blog.aragon.one/aragons-community-governance-model-2971df8f7817\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via \nCC0\n.",
