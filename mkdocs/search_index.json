No matter if\nbig chunks of functionality are swapped.\n\n\nTotally new permission system\n\n\nExtensible permission system to allow any entity to interact with another one using an ACL\n(Access Control List) that the kernel controls and maintains.\n\n\nSwitch to an exokernel architecture\n\n\nBy making the kernel a very simple contract that just keeps the ACL and keep references to\nthe installed apps, we can make it more secure and reduce the lines of code and complexity\nin apps, since there can be multiple instances of an app, also making upgradeability easier.\n\n\nFront-end modules API\n\n\nThis will let developers build modules for Aragon that extend its functionality.\nWe will provide an API for developers to access functionality from the Aragon client, and a UI\ntoolkit for them to adhere to our styling and UX patterns.\n\n\nCore modules API\n\n\nThe API will let the developer trigger actions inside the organization itself, and access more\nlow-level capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain projects that have already manifested interest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nAlpha\n: November 2017\n\n\nBug bounty (mainnet)\n: From November 2017 to February 2018\n\n\nPrivate Beta (mainnet)\n: February 2018\n\n\n\n\nThis will be the first release that gets deployed to the mainnet.\nAfter 3 months of public bug bounties in the mainnet, we will start allowing the first\ncompanies to be created using Aragon in the mainnet.\n\n\n0.6 \u2014 The Sweet Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis release will focus on adding:\n\n\nOrganization-wide datastores\n\n\nUsing a connector for IPFS/Swarm and the Aragon Versioning Protocol, we will provide a\nsecond layer that will give storage capabilities to the dapp. This way, new features and UX\nsugar will be able to be added to the organizations. Example: setting a company\u2019s logo, or\nimplementing an organization-wide identity system, instead of public ones.\n\n\nModule developer incentives plan\n\n\nWe will provide a module store and incorporate an incentives system for developers to be\nrewarded.\n\n\nDifferent upgrade tracks\n\n\nWe will provide different upgrade options.  This is what we are targeting:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic upgrades: The network will automatically upgrade the organization.\n\n\nDelegated upgrades: A representative appointed by the org will upgrade it.\n\n\nUpgrades by voting: A majority of voting power will approve upgrades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nAlpha\n: January 2018\n\n\nBug bounty (mainnet)\n: February 2018\n\n\nPrivate Beta (mainnet)\n: March 2018\n\n\n\n\n0.7 \u2014 The Network Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis release will focus on adding:\n\n\nBasic network-wide governance\n\n\nWhich power the network will have over organizations, governance votings to decide on\nservice providers, payouts functionality.\n\n\nANT token minting\n\n\nThe network will be responsible for the minting policy of ANT, it will be decided through the\ngovernance of the network. Some of its responsibilities will be to decide the issueing rate,\nthe price and how companies pay for the subscription to the network.\n\n\nInitial Aragon Dev proposal\n\n\nFirst proposal by Aragon Dev to Aragon Network for funding and further development\nmilestones.\n\n\nIntegrate upgradeability\n\n\nProvide upgradeability as a network service for all Aragon Network organizations.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nAlpha\n: March 2018\n\n\nBug bounty (mainnet)\n: April 2018\n\n\nProduction deploy (mainnet)\n: May 2018\u2029\n\n\n\n\n0.8 \u2014 The Court Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis release will focus on adding:\n\n\nAragon Jurisdiction\n\n\nProvide a decentralized court, Aragon Jurisdiction, as network service or work with a\ndecentralized court project to make it work with the network.\n\n\nOrgs in the AN respond to ANJ\n\n\nOrganizations in the Aragon Network start being under the Aragon Jurisdiction.\n\n\nConstitution proposal\n\n\nFirst proposal for the basic laws that all companies will be act under.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nAlpha\n: Q3 2018\n\n\nBug bounty (mainnet)\n: Q3-Q4 2018\n\n\nProduction deploy (mainnet)\n: Q4 2018\u2029\n\n\n\n\n0.9 \u2014 The Unknown Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a wildcard release. The ecosystem is evolving very quickly and we don't know what\ninteresting features we may want to add that will make the 1.0 release more appealing.\n\n\nSome ideas of what we might work on here:\n\n\nPrivacy-focused companies\n\n\nzkSnarks\n could provide companies with way more privacy. Private voting and ownership are\nvery interesting concepts we are researching about.\n\n\nDifferent governance mechanisms\n\n\nUntil now Aragon companies and the Network will be simple liquid democracy based\nentities.  \n\n\nWe are closely following research and experimentation on other governance mechanisms\nsuch as \nFutarchy\n.\n\n\n1.0 \u2014 The Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect to start marketing Aragon to the mainstream with this release.

A UNIX-inspired permissions system, that allows safe and efficient control over software resources by utilizing smart contracts.\n\n\nSmart contracts can define the rules and penalties around an agreement. They can also make decisions as well as enforce said commitments. Such as the ability to move large amounts of funds. But such significant responsibilities also make smart contracts a prime target for attacks.  Smart contracts are essential to to the Ethereum ecosystem. Testing and certifying them is not an absolute remedy because, inevitably, humans make mistakes.\n\n\nSo how does one guarantee DAOs that run efficiently and securely? And with upgradeability, ensuring the safety and evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem?\n\n\nWe present our take on our secure decentralized operating system: \nAragonOS\n.\n\n\nThis document provides a technical overview about the architecture. For a less technical oriented introduction to AragonOS, you can check the \nannouncement blogpost\n.\n\n\n1. Kernel and the Access Control List\n\n\nThe Access Control List (ACL) is the filter which determines whether an address has a certain role in the context of an app. It either permits or prohibits performing actions in a given context, such as an update, as well as determining the entities with power over that permission.\n\n\nThe ACL permissions system is inspired by UNIX. ACL controls the permissions in the system afforded to a user and can ease the transfer of permissions. Similar to the \nsudo\n command in UNIX, users can escalate permissions, but with more flexibility and granularity.\n\n\nApps\n\n\nApps are smart contracts that rely on the Kernel--the core of the operating system--for their own ACL and code upgrades. Because apps are upgradeable, we can rely on them to exist for a long period of time. This means it is safe for an app to be responsible for owning different assets on behalf of the DAO (e.g. tokens and ENS names). Apps can implement multiple actions and these actions can be protected or not by the ACL, in case one action is protected, execution of the action will only be allowed when permitted by the ACL.\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nAnother feature in ensuring security within the ecosystem is the ease of delegating responsibilities for autonomous execution. Apps can define any number of roles and roles can group one or more actions behind them. In order to perform an action protected by the ACL, the entity wishing to perform it must have the permission to execute that role\u2019s actions.\n\n\nRoles are always unique to each app. Being able to perform a given role in one app does not grant the permission to perform the role in other apps. An entity can have many roles in one app.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\ncontract TokenApp is App {\nbytes32 constant public MINT_ROLE = 0x1234;\n    function mint(address _receiver, uint256 _amount) auth(MINT_ROLE) { \u2026 }\n}\n\n\n\n\nEntity\n\n\nAn Entity is any actor that is represented by an Ethereum address, such as a multisig (an account that needs multiple signatures before executing an action), an app (for example a voting app that will execute an action if token holders vote favorably) or a simple private key controlled account.\n\n\nThe system can delegate permissions to groups of entities by implementing a Group app. As other apps, it can rely on the ACL for protecting important functions such as adding or removing members of the group. When group members want to execute a specific action, the Group app acts as a proxy contract that performs the action on behalf of the group.\n\n\nPermissions\n\n\nA Permission is assigned to an Entity and allows the \nentity\n to execute actions related to a particular \nrole\n in a smart contract with address \napp\n. The three methods described in this section, \ncreatePermission\n, \ngrantPermission\n and \nrevokePermission\n, all live in the Kernel.\n\n\nIf an Entity is the parent \nPa\n of a Permission \nP\n, it has the power to grant or revoke access to \nP\n for any other Entity that has been granted \nP\n with parent \nPa\n. This is achieved by calling:\n\n\nGrant Permission\n\n\nkernel.grantPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role, address parent)\n\n\n\n\nThe \nentity\n would then be allowed to call all actions that their \nrole\n can perform on that particular \napp\n. This would be in effect until its permission \nparent\n revokes it by calling \nrevokePermission\n.\n\n\nIn order for an Entity \nA\n to be able to \ngrantPermission\n that \nallows\n Entity \nB\n to perform actions in role \nX\n on a given app, all of the following conditions must be met:\n\n\n\n\nEntity \nA\n must already have permission \nP\n to perform role \nX\n actions.\n\n\nEntity \nA\n must be it\u2019s own permission parent \nPa\n for permission \nP\n.\n\n\nEntity \nB\n does not have any permission to perform role \nX\n actions (avoids being able to takeover as parent).\n\n\n\n\nWhen setting a Permission \nP\n, the one granting the permission can specify the Entity that will be the parent for \nP\n:\n\n\n\n\nIf \nparent \u2260 entity\n, this would grant a permission to \nentity\n which could be removed by \nparent\n.\n\n\nIf \nparent = entity\n, it would be equivalent to permanently granting the permission to the \nentity\n, so that only the parent entity itself could revoke it. Making the receiving entity its own parent also allows it to grant the permission to other entities.\n\n\nMaking \nparent\n an address whose private key is unknown (e.g. \n0xdead\n) would effectively prevent the permission to be transferred in the future, while at the same time making it irrevocable.\n\n\n\n\nThe \ngrantPermission\n action doesn\u2019t need to be protected with the ACL as an entity can only make changes if it is the \nparent\n for a given permission.\n\n\nRevoke Permission\n\n\nkernel.revokePermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\nrevokePermission\n can be called at any time by the \nparent\n of a certain permission and will remove the ability of \nentity\n to have \nrole\n on \napp\n.\n\n\nThe \nrevokePermission\n action doesn\u2019t need to be protected by the ACL either, as an entity can only make changes if it is the \nparent\n for a given permission.\n\n\nCreating new permissions from scratch for a newly installed app requires the use of another method:\n\n\nCreate Permission\n\n\nkernel.createPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role, address parent)\n\n\n\n\ncreatePermission\n will fail if there is already an entity with that permission. For this to happen, the ACL keeps track of the number of entities that have been granted a certain permission. If the counter for a permission is 0, \ncreatePermission\n will succeed.\n\n\nThis call is mostly identical to \ngrantPermission\n, with the exception that it allows the creation of a new permission from scratch if it doesn\u2019t yet exist.\n\n\nThe \ncreatePermission\n action needs to be protected by the ACL with a role. It is an important function that could be used in malicious ways. When the Kernel is instantiated, it will also create the permission for an address to create new permissions.\n\n\nIf the ACL is checked for a permission that hasn\u2019t been created yet, the ACL won\u2019t allow the action to be performed by default.\n\n\ncreatePermission\n, \ngrantPermission\n and \nrevokePermission\n fire the same event that Aragon clients must cache and use to build a locally stored version of the ACL.\n\n\nPermissionSet(address from, bytes32 role, address to, address parent, bool allowed)\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nAs an example, the following shows a complete flow for user Root to create a new DAO that has the basic permissions set so a Voting app could manage funds in a Vault app:\n\n\n\n\nDeploy the Kernel\n\n\nPerforming \nkernel.instantiate(rootAddress)\n creates the following permission under the hood:\n\n\ncreatePermission(rootAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, kernelAddress, rootAddress)\n\n\nDeploy the Voting app\n\n\nMake it so that the Voting app can call \ncreatePermission\n:\n\n\ncreatePermission(votingAppAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, kernelAddress, votingAppAddress)\n\n\nDeploy the Vault app, which has a signature called \ntransferTokens\n\n\nCreate a new vote to create the \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n permission\n\n\ncreatePermission(votingAppAddress, TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE, vaultAppAddress, votingAppAddress)\n\n\nIf vote passes, the Voting app can then call \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n actions, which in this case is just \ntransferTokens\n in the Vault\n\n\nVotes can be created to transfer funds\n\n\n\n\nAn initial implementation of the explained ACL can be found in \naragon-core\u2019s Kernel\n file.\n\n\nChecking Permissions\n\n\nApps can decide whether to protect actions behind the ACL or not, as for some actions it makes sense to have them completely public. Protecting an action behind the ACL is done simply by adding the authentication modifier which passes the role required for performing the action as a parameter. The auth modifier will check with the Kernel whether the entity performing the call has that role or not.\n\n\nEscalating Permissions\n\n\nConsider kernel \nK\n, an entity \nE\n0\n and an app \nA\n. \nE\n wants to perform action \nA\nsig\n on app \nA\n. The client knows (provided as part of app metadata) that in order to perform \nA\nsig\n an entity is required to have \nA\nrole\n.\nThe client should know that \nE\n0\n cannot directly call \nA\nsig\n, as it doesn\u2019t have that role, but that a list of Entities [\nE\n1\n, \nE\n2\n] do have that role on app \nA\n. The client should then show the user the multiple possible forwarding paths to pass the call to \nE\n1\n, so then \nE\n0\n could perform \nA\nsig\n.\n\n\nCalculating a forwarding path requires knowing what Forwarders entity \nE\n0\n can perform actions through.\nThe user or contract performing this action could then choose their preferred route to scale permissions in order to perform \nA\nsig\n. For example, \nE\n1\n may be a Voting app \nV\n, so the action would be to create a new vote that, in case of being approved, would call \nA\nsig\n. Since \nV\n has role \nA\nrole\n it has permission to execute \nA\nsig\n, therefore we would have successfully completed a permission escalation.\n\nNote that permission escalation can occur automatically or it can be delayed and require further action by other entities like in the case of the voting app.\n\n\n\n\nForwarders\n\n\nIn order to make permission escalation easier, we can define a common interface for how this happens:\n\n\ncontract Forwarder {\n   bool isForwarder = true;\n   function canForward(address sender, bytes evmCallScript) view returns (bool);\n   function forward(bytes evmCallScript);\n}\n\n\n\n\nEVM Call Script\n\n\nThe \nevmCallScript\n parameter allows for executing multiple calls with just one transaction. This is useful, for example, in the case of Votings, as it allows approving multiple actions in just one vote.\n\n\nAn \nevmCallScript\n is the concatenation of multiple \nevmCallActions\n. A \nevmCallActions\n payload is:\n\n\n[ to (address: 20 bytes) ] [ calldataLength (uint32: 4 bytes)  ] [ calldata (calldataLength bytes) ]\n\n\nWhen executed, actions in the \nevmCallScript\n are executed one at a time using \nCALL\n. If just one of the actions fails (call returns 0), the entire execution is reverted.\n\n\nAn implementation for EVM Call Script can be found here: \nEVMCallScript.sol\n.\n\n\nIf a user wants to enact an action it cannot perform directly, it can check if there are forwarders. This checks if there are entities which can perform the action that any of the user addresses can use.\n\n\nThis can be multiple levels deep. For example, if a user address holds a number of tokens, the user is allowed to use the token manager entity. This is something that forwards when the sender owns tokens. The token manager entity is then the only one allowed to create a new vote.\n\n\n2. Kernel-space upgradeability\n\n\nFor the \nKernel\n to be easily upgradeable, more efficient and cheaper to deploy, we will use a proxy type construct. Deploying a new DAO is done by deploying a \nKernelProxy\n contract that just delegates all calls to a kernel implementation at a given address, while still maintaining its own storage. Upgrading the kernel is as easy as changing the reference to another implementation. Even though it is fairly easy to do, this function really should be protected.\n\n\n3. App-space upgradeability\n\n\nAs apps can be used as entities (e.g. a voting app) it is important that the apps can keep their addresses fixed for maintaining their identities even if their underlying logic changes. This is in order to keep the permissions not having to change at the kernel level with the upgrades.\n\n\nAn idea of how this can be achieved is by using the concept of \nAppProxy\n contracts (inspired by \naugur-core\u2019s Delegators\n). Deploying an app with an AppProxy contract just needs a reference to the Kernel and the app identifier. When the app receives a call, it gets intercepted by the fallback function. At this point the proxy contract will ask the Kernel for the address of the latest version of the app code for a given app identifier. The \nAppProxy\n contract will then \ndelegatecall\n into this address, making sure that the latest version of the app is always running.\n\n\n\n\nGiven that the Kernel will have a centralized record of the latest version of the code for the app identifiers, changing one reference in the Kernel will effectively update all instances of the app relying on the Kernel. These upgrades could then be delegated to another contract, Aragon Network, in case the users don\u2019t wish to handle manual upgrades of the apps.\n\n\nkernel.setAppCode(bytes32 appId, address appCode)\n\n\n\n\nThis action updates the implementation code registered for a given \nappId\n. That will effectively upgrade all apps that depend on the Kernel. Making it so that all future calls will use the new app code.\nIn case the \nappId\n for an \nappCode\n hasn\u2019t been set, all calls to the app will fail.\n\n\n4. Initialization\n\n\nThe contract that gets deployed doesn\u2019t contain the business logic for the component. This is due to the Kernel and apps relying on a Proxy-like architecture for upgradeability. It is merely a way to point to the given logic when called.\n\n\nThis impedes the ability to call the Solidity constructor. Constructors are only ran when creating the contract, but not stored in the account bytecode. The arguments for the call and a standalone initialization function is needed for this.\n\n\nIt is important that this initialization function can only be called once. Instead of just saving a boolean when a component has been initialized, we store the block number when the initialization happened. This can then be used by client to know from which block they need to filter for events.\n\n\n5. App discoverability and package versioning\n\n\nAn app \nA\n is nothing more than a simple AppProxy contract with a reference to a kernel \nK\n and an \nappId\n. If \nA\n doesn\u2019t have any permissions, both incoming or outgoing, set in \nK\n, it effectively means that it\u2019s irrelevant to the DAO, since nothing can call it and it cannot call anything. So the notion of installing an app is replaced with the notion of creating permissions for an app (what needs to happen for different functions of the app to be called and what can the app do in regard to other apps).\n\n\nAll relevant apps in a DAO could be obtained by traversing its ACL, checking if an address there is an AppProxy, and checking if the AppProxy has a reference to the DAO\u2019s kernel. If that happens, an app with the AppProxy\u2019s \nappId\n is effectively installed in the DAO.\n\n\nApplication identifiers (\nappId\n) can be used as a the identifier for the full package (frontend for the app and other artifacts).\nThe \nappId\n of an app should be the ENS name for the package. The \nnamehash\n function recursively hashes different components of a name (\nreference implementation\n)\n\n\nappId = namehash(\u201cvoting.aragonpm.eth\u201d)\n\n\n\n\nAragon owns \naragonpm.eth\n and will allow developers to create packages, but the system is designed to be domain agnostic (for example, district0x could decide to have all their packages under \npackages.district.eth\n)\n\n\nAfter discovering an entity in the DAO that is an app, we can fetch its appId and because the appId is a ENS name, we can lookup in the ENS to find the full repo contract for an appId.\n\n\nrepo = Resolver(ens.resolver(appId)).addr(appId)\n\n\n\n\nRepo contracts conform to the original Aragon Versioning Protocol but add more on-chain checks for what a valid version update is.  \n\n\nThe Repo has an owner which is an Ethereum address that can create new versions of the package. This ownership right can be transferred to another address by the owner.  \n\n\nA Repo allows to keep versioned state over:  \n\n\n\n\nSmart contract app code (\ncontractAddress\n): the app code is the address of the deployed version of the app. The kernel can then point to this address and all instances of the app, depending on the kernel it will use.\n\n\nPackage content (\ncontentURI\n): defined by a location id of where the package is hosted (IPFS, Swarm, etc.) and a content hash to fetch it.\n\n\n\n\nBy having both the app code reference and the package content, we can assert some guarantees of what the semantic versioning means.\n\n\n\n\nPatch version\n: Minor changes to the package contents (frontend). Update can be performed silently for users.\n\n\nMinor version\n: Major changes to the package contents, but still works with the current  smart contract code (frontend). Users should be notified of the update.\n\n\nMajor version\n: Changes to both the smart contracts and the frontend. In order to use this version of the frontend, an upgrade to new smart contract(s) is required. User interaction is needed to upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nBy having this check performed at the smart contract level, we can load the correct version of the frontend just by looking at an instance of an app. This is done by checking that the version of a smart contract is linked to a given app by getting the appId and the appCode.\n\n\nA correct version raise for a package is defined by the following rules:\n\n\n\n\nIt can only increase one member of the version by 1. The version components at the left of the raised member must stay the same and the components at the right must be 0.\n\n\nExample: From 2.1.3 the only allowed rises are to 3.0.0 (major version), 2.2.0 (minor version) and 2.1.4 (patch version).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges to the app code address can only be done if the raise changes the major version (turning it into x.0.0 by the above rule).\n\n\n\n\nThe package that is stored off-chain needs to contain a standard \nmanifest.json\n file.\nApart from that, making the interaction with the smart contracts possible, we introduce a specific \neth.json\n file with the following keys:\n\n\n\n\nabi\n: Standard \nEthereum Contract ABI\n\n\nbytecode\n: Init code for deploying the app contract to the network.\n\n\nfunctions\n: An array of all the relevant function signatures for the contract, with its \nnatspec\n description, argument names and whether the function is protected by the ACL or not. These can be automatically generated on package publish. What role is needed to call a function is specified in the function object.\n\n\npermissions\n: An array of what permissions the app needs to have over other entities in order to work. This will probably be dependent on initialization parameters. For example: a Finance app will need permissions over the Vault it is initialized with.\n\n\nverification\n: An object providing the needed information to independently verify the source code of the deployed code. Values needed are: \ndeployTxId\n, \nsourceCode\n and the compiler settings, solc version and optimization settings.\n\n\n\n\nAn initial implementation of the contracts supporting package management can be found on the apm-contracts Github \nrepo\n.",

In order to remove the need of a trusted prices feed (oracle) for token exchange rate, every token is accounted on its own for budgeting and period financial statements.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nAccounting period\n\n\nAccounting periods are the equivalent of financial quarters in traditional organizations. Their length can be set depending on how the organization wants to use them.\n\n\nFor every accounting period, a balance (called token statement) for every transacted token is kept, this balance will be negative if more was spent than deposited and positive if otherwise.\n\n\nTransactions\n\n\nA transaction records an event in which assets were deposited or spent through the Finance app. Spend transactions are called 'outgoing transactions' and deposits 'incoming transactions'. Every transaction occurs in an accounting period and counts towards its token statement.\n\n\nTransactions cannot be created directly, they are recorded as the result of an operation (either a payment being executed or a deposit made).\n\n\nPayments\n\n\nPayments are the construct used for spending using the Finance app. A payment can be created to happen only once or it can be a recurring payment that will be performed according to a certain time schedule.\n\n\nIf executing a payment succeeds, it creates an outgoing transaction with a reference to the payment.\n\n\nBudgets\n\n\nBudgets give the ability to limit how much units of a token can be spent per Accounting period. Budgets are set in a token per token basis. By default no token has a budget, which means unlimited spending is allowed.\n\n\nOnce a budget has been set for a token, the Finance app will only allow the budgeted amount of tokens to be spent for that period.\n\n\nInitialization\n\n\nInitializing a Finance app requires the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\nVault:\n a reference to a \nVault\n instance that the Finance app will use for depositing and spending tokens. In order for it to work correctly, the Finance app \nmust have permissions to transfer Vault's tokens\n.\n\n\nEther token\n: address of the EtherToken instance used as ether.\n\n\nAccounting period duration\n: the initial duration for accounting periods.

To prevent it going out of gas when many transfers are due, a maximum amount of transfers are performed per execution (multiple executions could be needed in some instances).\n\n\nPayments can always be executed by its recipient, but there is also an additional role to the Finance app that allows another entity to execute the payment (recipient gets the funds in both instances).\n\n\nFor payments whose token is the known EtherToken, instead of doing a token transfer, it will directly transfer ether to the recipient.\n\n\nA payment execution can fail in case the organization is out of budget for the payment token for that particular accounting period, or the organization doesn't have enough token balance.\n\n\nDisabling payments\n\n\nfinance.setPaymentDisabled(uint256 _paymentId, bool _disabled)\n\n\n\n\nAt any time, a payment can be disabled by an authorized entity.

Automatic transitions will only perform 10 transitions maximum, and if more were needed the operation will fail. In case this lock occurs and periods cannot be automatically transitioned, multiple period transitions operations can be triggered manually to remove the lockup.\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\n\n\nPayments are allowed to be created but can make it go out of budget.

Pierre is a Frontend Developer that will help the team in fulfilling the Aragon vision. We talked about his experience as a software developer making beautiful user experiences, his thoughts on Ethereum, what tools he uses and what tips he has for aspiring developers and teams working in the space.\n\n\n\n\nOctober\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Luke, Aragon\u2019s Research Lead\n\n\nLuke and I talked about how he got involved with Ethereum and Aragon as well as what he sees that the future holds for them\n\n\n\n\nOur team has grown and gained a new member again! Today we\u2019re introducing Luke as a new addition. We discussed how he got into working on Ethereum and Aragon, what his vision of their future is and what he\u2019s most excited about getting to work on.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q3 Development Update\n\n\n\n\nThis quarter we have been hard at work developing the new \nv0.5 release\n. This release paves the way for Aragon to be an extendable governance tool which supports all possible use cases. It has required an immense amount of changes, including a re-architecturing called \nAragonOS\n\n\n\n\nAragon Chat is now open\n\n\nAragon starts using the open source messaging platform Rocket Chat\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re happy to inform you that the migration to Rocket Chat is now complete.\nAll users and public channels have been migrated over to the new platform, so feel free to jump in and join the conversation!\nTo use the new Aragon Chat, you can connect directly via the web page or download one of the clients available for Rocket Chat and point it to https://aragon.chat\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing AragonOS: Say hi to modular and extendable organizations\n\n\nAragon\u2019s new exokernel-inspired architecture\n\n\n\n\nAragonOS\n smart contract architecture is based on the idea of an organization being the aggregate of multiple components (called \napplications\n) and a pillar that is the \nKernel\n, which governs how these applications can talk to each other and how other entities can interact with them.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\n\n\nAragon will be Community Governed\n\n\nWhat community governance really entails\n\n\n\n\nSince the inception of the project, Aragon\u2019s vision has been to be open source software and to give power over it to the people who use it. The whole platform will be a community effort\u200a\u2014\u200aand it will take time to build it as envisioned.\n\n\nRight now we are a community based project and our long-term plan is to be a community governed project. To learn why this has been our vision for the project, where we are at the moment and how we plan on achieving our goals, let\u2019s take a look into the history and definition of these terms\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing Our Migration To An Open Source Messaging Platform\n\n\nAragon will migrate to Rocket Chat along with 10 other Ethereum projects\n\n\n\n\nToday we are announcing the plan of several Ethereum based projects to migrate to the open source messaging platform Rocket Chat.\n\n\nAragon will be migrating our community out of Slack and onto Rocket Chat in the next couple of weeks.\n\n\nThis has been a joint effort from the projects participating in the migration plan. Aragon initially started the proposal for the community after there had already been discussion on the subject from multiple projects. We came together as members of the same ecosystem and community to work on this plan to find an alternative that fit the needs of these cryptocurrency projects.\n\n\n\n\nAugust\n\n\nWhy Transparency Matters\n\n\nAragon Transparency Model and the unveiling of Aragon\u2019s new Transparency Framework\n\n\n\n\nAt Aragon, we feel obliged to show to our community\u200a\u2014\u200asupporters, contributors and token holders\u200a\u2014\u200athat we are being productive, effective and using the raised funds in a responsible manner.\n\n\nThe community is very important to us, they are the ones that we\u2019re building this project for. They support us, provide feedback and ideas on how we can all move forward while catering the needs of the users. In turn, we want to uphold our high transparency standards to keep the community up to date on what we are doing.\n\n\nThis is why we\u2019re showcasing our model for doing things transparently.\n\n\nThis all began with our Pre-Sale Transparency Report. And recently continued with the Token Buyback Transparency Report.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll now present you with all the different methods we\u2019re employing. The parts of our project\u2019s transparency model, starting with the new Transparency Framework.\n\n\n\n\nToken Buyback Transparency Report\n\n\nWhy did we buy back ANT and how we will disclose these events\n\n\n\n\nToday, adhering to our high transparency standards, we\u2019re ready to take the first step in our plan to extend our level of transparency\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is why we\u2019re reporting our token buybacks.\n\n\nIn our Intended Use of Revenue post we outlined the broad estimated allocation of our funds. As the development of our project has continued, we\u2019ve been able to narrow down some of the use cases of which we\u2019ll use our funds for.\n\n\n\n\nJuly\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Oliver, Aragon\u2019s Senior Full Stack Web3 Engineer\n\n\nOliver and I discussed how he got started with Ethereum, how he came to work at Aragon and where he sees the project going\n\n\n\n\nWe have a new addition to our Dev Team! Today we\u2019re introducing Oliver as a new team member. He expresses his views on Ethereum, his favourite projects and how we can all make Aragon better together.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Network Jurisdiction Part 1: Decentralized Court\n\n\n\n\nWhen first designing Aragon, the goal was to have organizations run entirely trustless. Thus, we created a platform to create organizations governed by trustless and immutable code. Now, when we say that these organizations run in a trustless manner, we\u2019re talking about how to describe the laws under which the code runs. Code is trustless when deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It won\u2019t change at the whim of a person, it will run as designed, following the logic set forth in it.\n\n\nYet, it was clear that we can\u2019t account for every possible circumstance in our code. Even if you manage to encode tons of variables into the code, there are things you cannot possibly encode because the blockchain isn\u2019t aware about the physical world. And often, in the case of disputes, things are subjective and up to interpretation.\n\n\nOur solution to this problem is the Aragon Network Jurisdiction. A decentralized jurisdiction to solve subjective disputes as an Aragon Network service.\n\n\n\n\nThe emergent Ethereum stack\n\n\ndistrict0x, the first manifestation of the Ethereum + Aragon stack\n\n\n\n\nSoftware allows us to abstract away from existing functionality to focus on building.\n\n\nAt Aragon, we use Ethereum. Ethereum provides us the consensus layer to establish truth. And the ability to create smart contracts that are self-enforcing.\n\n\nSo, generally speaking, we don\u2019t have to worry about Ethereum. We use Ethereum, driving usage to the platform, thus increasing its value. So we\u2019re indirectly funding its further development.\n\n\nThat\u2019s the virtuous circle that tokenization makes possible.\n\n\n\n\nAragon\u2019s Community Governance Model\n\n\nHow we plan to achieve transparency and inclusion for the community\n\n\n\n\nOur community is everything for us. With Aragon, we want a thousand communities to flourish. Tokens align the incentives of communities and projects towards the same goals and values. But those communities are the center of where the magic happens.\n\n\nTwo weeks ago we posted our Community Governance Model for feedback from the community. We received some comments on it, and we now have the final version of the model ready. Before this, we had already worked on the model internally. I drafted the original version and Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo provided their thoughts on it.\n\n\nFurther changes might be made as things develop. But we wanted to show the community what we\u2019ll be doing in terms of governance, transparency and inclusion.\n\n\nThe model was designed so that every community member will be treated equally. Everyone will have the same changes of participation, and our Meetings and decisions to be transparent.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Mihai Alisie as an Advisor\n\n\nWhy him, why now and the road ahead\n\n\n\n\nWe announced two of our Advisors before the successful ANT sale. Kenny Rowe from the MakerDAO project and Jake Brukhman of CoinFund. Both experts in their fields and respected members of the Ethereum community.\n\n\nWhile we did have our Board of Advisors in place before the token sale, we chose not to disclose all the members then.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q2 Development Update\n\n\nv0.4 release status and the road ahead\n\n\n\n\nWe will be delivering regular updates on the development of Aragon. This is our first quarterly update to bring the community up to speed on where we\u2019re at and the road ahead.\n\n\n\n\nJune\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Mar\u00eda, Aragon\u2019s Head of Strategy and Operations\n\n\nMar\u00eda shares her thoughts about Aragon and what got her into working on an Ethereum based project\n\n\n\n\nAs a continuation on our team interview series, I interviewed Mar\u00eda\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Head of Strategy and Operations\u200a\u2014\u200ato learn more about her, her interest in Ethereum, how she came to work, and her role, at Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nAragon to power the district0x Network\n\n\nWelcoming district0x to the Aragon Network Jurisdiction\n\n\n\n\nToday, we are pleased to introduce the first resident of the Aragon Network Jurisdiction, the district0x Network\n\n\nThe district0x Network is a collective of decentralized marketplaces and communities powered by Ethereum, Aragon, and IPFS. Markets on the network, also referred to as districts, are all built upon a shared framework comprised of smart contracts and front-end libraries which provide the functionality necessary to operate communal marketplaces which are similar to services like AirBNB, eBay, Uber, or Reddit with payments.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Harsh, Aragon\u2019s Product Engineer\n\n\nHarsh talks about how he came to work on a Ethereum project and where he sees Aragon going in the future\n\n\n\n\nAs a continuation on our team interview series, I interviewed Harsh\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Product Engineer\u2014 to learn more about him, his past ventures, how he came to work on Aragon, and his future vision for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nAragon partners with 0x\n\n\nMaking decentralized organizations go beyond Ether\n\n\n\n\nSo today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019re partnering with 0x to allow Aragon organizations to accept and operate with any token. 0x is a protocol for decentralized exchange on Ethereum allowing users to exchange tokens without a central broker\u200a\u2014\u200aending the many inefficiencies of centralization by enabling transparent token exchanges between contracts.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Tatu, Aragon\u2019s Community Lead\n\n\nTatu talks about why he is part of the Ethereum community and why he is so enthusiastic about Aragon and decentralization\n\n\n\n\nAs part of our team interview series (Luis\u2019 Interview|Jorge\u2019s Interview), I\u2019ve interviewed Tatu\u2014 Aragon\u2019s Community Lead\u200a\u2014\u200ato learn more about his experience in the Ethereum ecosystem, the projects he\u2019s most excited about, and why he chose to work for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nMay\n\n\nAnnouncing the ENS Aragon Network Company Registry\n\n\n\n\nWith Aragon, we set out to create software that makes it easy to create and run decentralized organizations. However, meaningless ETH addresses made sending funds and completing transactions for operating a business unnecessarily complicated.\n\n\nFortunately, ENS (Ethereum Name Service) recently solved this issue by enabling the assignment of human-readable names to eth addresses. This was important for the entire Ethereum ecosystem (including Aragon)\u2014 no longer do you have to send transactions to a series of numbers and letters.\n\n\nSo today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we won the bid for the name company.eth! In this post, we\u2019ll explain how Aragon organizations will use the name and the implications for Aragon Network user-adoption.\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Token Sale: The Numbers\n\n\nRoughly $25 million was collected in 26 minutes. The rate was $122k/s the first 3 blocks.\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, we closed the 4th largest crowdfunding event in history, and the 2nd largest in the blockchain space (after The DAO). Raising 275,000 ether, or roughly $25 million, we\u2019re incredibly humbled by the support of the community and the trust in our mission to make decentralized autonomous organizations widespread.\n\n\nIn this post, we\u2019d like to reflect on the last 48 hours, provide some data on the sale, and most importantly express our gratitude to the community.\n\n\n\n\nFinal token sale recap\n\n\n\n\nPlease read How to Securely Participate in the sale for information and tutorials on how to participate.\n\n\n\n\nPre-Sale Transparency Report\n\n\n\n\nBefore tomorrow\u2019s token sale, we believe it\u2019s important that we release a transparency report about the pre-sale. This post will provide you with details on who purchased ANT before the token sale, the terms of the sale, the total Ether received, and how those funds were used.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Token Sale Contracts Have Been Deployed and Activated\n\n\nANT sale begins on Ethereum mainnet\u2019s block 3,723,000\u200a\u2014\u200aMay 17, ~6pm GMT\n\n\n\n\nHow to Participate in the Sale\n\n\n\n\nWait for block 3,723,000 (May 17 at approximately 6pm GMT). You can check what the latest block is on Etherscan. After block 3,722,999 has been mined, it is safe to send the transaction. Note that sending the transaction before that block is mined will result in a loss of fees.\n\n\nSend ETH to the address posted on https://aragon.network\n\n\nSend at least 200,000 gas with your transaction.\n\n\nIf your contribution is accepted, tokens will be transferred to your address in the same transaction. However, tokens will not be transferable until the sale is finalized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the Aragon Community Multisig\n\n\nA 3/5 multisig that will approve the deployment of the Aragon Network\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network Token (ANT) will initially begin as an upgradable token, but will evolve to serve as the governance token for the Aragon Network when deployed.\n\n\nWe estimate that the Aragon Network will be deployed in May of 2018. Prior to deployment and transition to a governance token, we plan to perform numerous audits and bug bounties to ensure thorough testing and to mitigate the risk of another DAO hack.\n\n\nHowever, the actual ANT token will be first distributed in 2 days. So this raises the question: how do we plan to upgrade the token\u2019s functionality to a governance token?\n\n\n\n\nToken sale cap clarification\n\n\ntl;dr: Our cap is not $100m, or near that amount\n\n\n\n\nWe have had a lot of questions about our hidden cap mechanism.\n\n\nSince it\u2019s pretty new to the token sale world, we understand the confusion and want to provide a simple breakdown to clarify.\n\n\n\n\nToken Sale Audit Results\n\n\nNo Critical Issues Reported and Token Sale is On-Schedule\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure a stable and safe token sale, we employed the help of Jordi Baylina and Piper Merriam to perform independent audits of Aragon token sale contract code. Jordi and Piper completed their reports this week and published their independent findings (Jordi\u2019s Report | Piper\u2019s Report). No critical issues were reported in either independent audit. And for the issues that were found, we\u2019ve worked closely with Jordi and Piper to resolve them and improve the code.\n\n\nIn addition, we\u2019re happy to announce that there have been no critical issues reported through the bug bounty program. Thanks to all of those that have participated, and note that the bug bounty program will continue indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the Aragon Advisors\n\n\nKenny from MakerDAO and Jake from CoinFund will be advising Aragon\n\n\n\n\nWe are pleased to announce two people that we really admire in the Ethereum community will be joining us as advis0rs: Kenny Rowe and Jake Brukhman.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Sourcing Aragon\n\n\nMaking Aragon Code Accessible and Providing Documentation Soon\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 12, I got my first laptop\u200a\u2014\u200aa piece of junk with only 256MB of RAM. It was slow and literally falling apart. But this didn\u2019t stop me from developing. Using Linux, I had the latest available software. And thanks to thousands of developers around the world, I could examine different pieces of code and learn programming.\n\n\nThe free software and open source phenomena has not only made the world a more inclusive place, but it has also increased the speed of software development\u200a\u2014\u200aby sharing, developers no longer need to reinvent the wheel. For example, we didn\u2019t have to build the native app wrapper or the Ethereum wallet for Aragon.\n\n\nSo when we find something that we can give back to the community, we make a point of doing so. We\u2019ve found that by sharing code, others can learn from it (like I did as a teenager) and people will find ways to improve it.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Securely Participate in the Aragon Token Sale\n\n\nUsing Mist, Parity, My Ether Wallet, and Metamask\n\n\n\n\nThe ANT token sale is happening on May 17th! In anticipation, we\u2019ve been and will continue to frequently post about Aragon and sale details. In this post, we list the sources to trust for ANT sale information, and provide instructions for purchasing with Mist, Parity, My Ether Wallet, and Metamask.\n\n\n\n\nAragon On Tour: Meetups Around the Globe\n\n\nCome to one of our meetups, have a beer with us and talk decentralized awesomeness\n\n\n\n\nOn the Internet, nobody knows you\u2019re a dog. This has been extremely beneficial for the development of communities around the world, and crypto is perhaps one of the most remarkable examples.\n\n\nBut who doesn\u2019t like to have a beer with people that share common interests? It\u2019s part of our human nature!\n\n\nSo aside from being on Slack all day and night, we\u2019ve organized a series of meetups for Ethereum \n Aragon enthusiasts to get together to talk about exciting projects and have a few drinks!\n\n\n\n\nAragon Tutorial: Raising funds with a token\n\n\nHow you can raise capital creating your own token in a few clicks\n\n\n\n\nToken sales are changing the rules of the game, making it extremely easy for anyone in the world to gather capital and build new products.\n\n\nWith Aragon, you can create token sales in a few clicks and publish the sale address so everyone can participate.\n\n\n\n\nOur Public Product Roadmap and Issue Reporting\n\n\nEnhancing transparency in product development\n\n\n\n\nOften, product and software development is secretive and confidential until the official product launch. While this has the effect of building excitement, it can lead to unrealistic user expectations, development of products that are missing key features, and ultimately products that miss end-user needs.\n\n\nAs a result, we believe it\u2019s important to engage the community throughout the product development process\u200a\u2014\u200aand this is what we\u2019ve done while developing Aragon. The community has consistently provided valuable feedback and unique perspectives. From user interface design to our token model, feedback from the Aragon community has guided Aragon Core and Network development.\n\n\n\n\nAragon token sale bug bounty\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited to announce that we are conducting a bug bounty in advance of the Aragon Network Token sale. We believe bug bounties are essential to ensuring a safe release, and are especially important when cryptocurrency is being exchanged. This post will provide more details on our bug bounty program scope, the timeline, and compensation.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Tutorial: Tokens and voting\n\n\nHow you can easily create your own token and govern your organization with it\n\n\n\n\nFrom the beginning, we wanted Aragon to be a tool that anyone can use. So we put a lot of thought into making things easy.\n\n\nTo make things even easier, we are starting a series of short videos that explain every part of Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nOur Intended Use of Revenue\n\n\nHow we plan to use the token sale to drive development\n\n\n\n\nAs previously announced, the Aragon Network Token (ANT) sale will be conducted on May 17th. The funds raised will fund Aragon Core development and the Network deployment.\n\n\nThe specific steps and timeline to make Aragon production ready are outlined in our development plan, released last week. In this post, we\u2019re excited to provide details on our intended use of revenue from the token sale.\n\n\n\n\nApril\n\n\nAragon + Status: Bringing decentralized organizations everywhere\n\n\nGetting ready to offer Aragon to 2.3bn smartphone users\n\n\n\n\nOur mission at Aragon is to make decentralized organizations widespread.\n\n\nTo achieve our mission, we built a dApp to easily create and operate decentralized organizations on Ethereum. First, we focused on building a feature rich web and desktop (including MacOS, Linux, and Windows) application.\n\n\nBut our initial focus ignored a major way that over 2.3 billion people interact with applications today: their smartphones. The reason we ignored these users was simple\u200a\u2014\u200athe development effort to create mobile applications is significant and would distract from developing fully featured web and desktop versions.\n\n\n\n\nA note for exchanges or holders interacting with ANT in an automated manner\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network Token has vesting built in that limits the transferability of the token until a specified time.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Token Sale Technical Overview\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: ANT is a MiniMe Token with built-in vesting functionality. Two security audits are currently being performed and a bug bounty will begin soon. ANT contract code is live on Github.\n\n\nThis post will discuss the ANT base token and its functionality, the ANT sale contract, and the current state of ANT security and future efforts to ensure a successful token sale.\n\n\n\n\nThe path to mainstream decentralized organizations\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, we published our development plan for Aragon Core and the Aragon Network. This post explains in greater detail our structure to store and allocate funds from Aragon Network Token (ANT) sales, features of the next Aragon Core release, and plans to deploy the Aragon Network and its first organizations.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the Aragon Development Plan\n\n\nThe road ahead to make decentralized organizations widespread\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we announced our token sale and its terms.\n\n\nToday, we will be addressing the future of Aragon, by releasing our Development Plan.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Network Token sale terms\n\n\nFounder vesting, simple pricing and distribution\n\n\n\n\nYesterday we announced the Aragon Network Token sale. Today, we will go into its details. For a simple overview of the sale in just one page, download the one pager.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the Aragon Network Token sale\n\n\nANT sale starts on May 17th. Bootstrapping the creation of the world\u2019s first digital jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\nWe have been asked countless times about whether we would do a token sale or not. Our answer always was: if it makes sense, we will!\n\n\nAfter launching Aragon, we spent a lot of time talking to people and thinking. What will be the main issues to make decentralized organizations widespread?\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Luis, Aragon\u2019s Project Lead\n\n\nLuis talks about why he is creating Aragon and his long-term vision for it\n\n\n\n\nI have interviewed my cofounder Luis\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Project Lead\u200a\u2014\u200aand asked him about the future of the project, and his long term vision.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the Aragon Network\n\n\nSolving the biggest hurdles to make decentralized organizations widespread\n\n\n\n\nOur first step was to develop an extremely easy to use product on top of the Ethereum blockchain that lets everyone run decentralized organizations. Now we have validated the concept, the market interest and most importantly, the main hurdles to realize our vision.\n\n\nThose main hurdles to make decentralized organizations widespread are upgradeability and decentralized arbitration.\n\n\n\n\nThe 8 pillars of any organization\n\n\nA walk-through of Aragon and the why behind each feature\n\n\n\n\nWhen we set out to create Aragon, we researched what were the core features that an organization needs.\n\n\nLast year, the 11th of November, we came up with the first version of the product full spec. Most of the features that you see today in Aragon, as well as how they are structured, were laid out that month.\n\n\nSince we have been asked a few times which was our thought process to came up with that features, I\u2019ll go through it.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Jorge, Aragon\u2019s Tech Lead\n\n\nJorge talks about what excites him the most about Aragon, and the road ahead\n\n\n\n\nI have interviewed my cofounder Jorge\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Tech Lead\u200a\u2014\u200aand asked him about the Ethereum community, his workspace and the road ahead.\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized organizations can solve the world\u2019s worst problems\n\n\nDisintermediating human trade\u200a\u2014\u200abusiness\u200a\u2014\u200ais the first step towards a more fair world\n\n\n\n\nWe take most power for granted. After all, humans enforce most of their social contracts by giving away some freedom.\n\n\nWe usually think about intermediaries in a microscopic scale. We think about the guy who delivered us a package. Or the agency we hired to find us a buyer for an apartment.\n\n\nYet those intermediaries are insignificant compared to the macro-scale intermediaries.\n\n\n\n\nMarch\n\n\nThe Governance Release, Alpha 0.3 \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\n\n\nBring your token, new bylaws, web version and more\n\n\n\n\nTokens are changing the rules of the game. We don\u2019t need to think about obscure business models anymore. We can align our users\u2019 incentives with ours and release a token that implements that logic.\n\n\nAt Aragon we believe that we are at the dawn of this token model.\n\n\nAnd we want to help the community in this journey.\n\n\nSo today, we are introducing ERC20 token support for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nReleasing Aragon Alpha \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n\nOne month ago, we introduced our vision of how companies and organizations will work. And we set to make it a reality.  \n\n\nToday, I want to personally thank all the community for the warmest welcome we could have ever dreamed of for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Solidity code deployment techniques\n\n\n\n\nThis is a continuation post to the work we did with Zeppelin for the article on Proxy libraries for code upgradeability. Reading that post is not required in order to understand this one, but it is definitely a recommended read, as the ideas are pretty much on the same line. And towards the end we will combine them.\n\n\n\n\nElectron + MetaMask = Secure, Easy to Use Dapps \ud83d\udd12\n\n\nSandboxing Ethereum DApps with Electron\n\n\n\n\nWhen we chose what would be our main build target for Aragon, our priorities for choosing Electron + MetaMask were security and usability.  \n\n\nOf course Aragon also runs on any Web3 environment (like Mist, Parity, Chrome with MetaMask\u2026) but we wanted to have a build target in which we have full control over the user experience.  \n\n\nSince we got part of the community intrigued on how our implementation works, this post hopes to explain our decisions and the challenges we found.\n\n\n\n\nHow Aragon approaches identity and the Ethereum Keybase Resolver\n\n\n\n\nIdentity is one of the most important parts when developing decentralized applications. This is specially true for Aragon, where identity is needed to know who are you doing business with or who are the people that will manage the money you are investing.\n\n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n\nLibrary Driven Development in Solidity\n\n\n\n\nA comprehensive review on how to develop more modular, reusable and elegant smart contract systems on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine by using libraries\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Aragon: Unstoppable companies\n\n\n\n\nToday, taking a stand to help this fight, we are introducing Aragon.\n\nAragon is everything you need to operate your company or organizational structure, on Ethereum.\n\nAragon lets everyone create value without borders or intermediaries.\n\nCap table, vesting, payments, voting, bylaws, fundraising and identity all in a beautiful, unified interface.",

Code is trustless when deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It won\u2019t change at the whim of a person, it will run as designed, following the logic set forth in it.  Yet, it was clear that we can\u2019t account for every possible circumstance in our code. Even if you manage to encode tons of variables into the code, there are things you cannot possibly encode because the blockchain isn\u2019t aware about the physical world.

Prior to deployment and transition to a governance token, we plan to perform numerous audits and bug bounties to ensure thorough testing and to mitigate the risk of another DAO hack.  However, the actual ANT token will be first distributed in 2 days. So this raises the question: how do we plan to upgrade the token\u2019s functionality to a governance token?",
