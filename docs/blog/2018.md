**Progress of development from the last quarter of 2017**

### [**Aragon Team Update: December 2017**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-team-update-december-2017-cf076d3a46a3)
**Written reviews of what the team members have been up to**

> Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that’s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday’s meeting.
