# Apps

Aragon maintains a set of default apps that can be used to run basic organizations. These apps serve as an example of how AragonOS compatible apps are built.

At the moment, there are six apps as part of the [Aragon apps repo](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps):

- [Voting](./voting)
- [Token Manager](./token-manager)
- [Group](./group)
- [Fundraising](./fundraising)
